# Super basic HTTP server library

A super simple HTTP server library for Jai. 

Not intended to solve all of your problems, but it might allow you
to serve some stuff over HTTP.

This has intentionally been kept as close to oversimplified as possible.
First, because [Cavy](https://github.com/smari/Cavy), which I wrote while
sick with Covid, was never correctly scoped and was kind of silly. But fun.
Second, and more importantly, because these kinds of things tend to get
overly complicated alarmingly fast.

Anyway, enjoy.

## Usage

Example in `test.jai`.
